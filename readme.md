These programs create a graphical user interface (GUI) to make different quantitative sensory testing protocols easier to perform.

The protocols use the TCS temperature stimulator from QSTlab; the eVAS and a cold plate from the same manufacturer; and EEG device from Mentalab to record resting state EEG and contact heat evoked potentials (CHEPS).

The evaluation include pain5 thresholds for heat and cold; temporal summation of pain and conditioned pain modulation; heat pain and cold pain thresholds; offset analgesia; resting EEG during cold pressor test and CHEPs.

The scripts store the relevant data for each participant in csv files.

The python code is made to be run with anaconda.
